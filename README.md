A customer segmentation analysis was conducted using the Northwind dataset. As part of this analysis, recency, frequency, and monetary values were calculated for each customer to create a score. Based on these scores, customers were segmented into VIP, Gold, Silver, and Bronze categories. After the segmentation, the regions where these customer groups are located were visualized on a cartographic map. This made it easier to identify which regions the most valuable customers are located in.

On the Sales page, fundamental analyses such as the top-selling product category, the best-selling product, and the country with the highest sales were performed to understand the main sources of revenue. Additionally, graphs were created to understand the discount, sales, and net profit ratios categorically and to observe the most profitable product category.

Furthermore, to understand annual growth, graphical representations of sales volumes and net returns were provided.

For logistics companies, analyses were performed to determine which shipping company could deliver a product to a region at the lowest cost.

Employee-focused analyses included metrics such as gender distribution, job titles, employee regions, sales ratios, discount rates, and profit rates. These metrics were used to evaluate the value employees bring to the company and to assess their performance.
